dotfiles
========

My basic config files meant to be pulled down and used in different environments.

Clone into .dotfiles like so:

    git clone git@github.com:michaelcoyote/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

For now I'm linking by hand using `ln -s .dotfiles/blah ~/.blah`, but in the future I would prefer to get `DFlink.sh` to a place where it will do the right thing and install my dotfiles correctly..
