# basic aliases file 
# this is for things that don't really need a function of their own
# should be portable and not tied to functions so much but strictly
# local aliases should end up in bash_local

# alias changing to commonly used directories
alias work='cd ~/work/'
alias cdn='cd ~/notes/'
# its 2025, every term has color now
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
# Default dirs output more useful
alias dirs="dirs -v"
