# basic aliases file 
# this is for things that don't really need a function of their own
# should be portable and not tied to functions so much but strictly
# local aliases should end up in bash_local

# alias changing to commonly used directories
alias work='cd ~/working/'
alias cdsn='cd ~/Documents/work/site_notes/'

# Default dirs output more useful
alias dirs="dirs -v"
