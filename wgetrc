### Wget initialization file .wgetrc
##
## Wget initialization file can reside in /etc/wgetrc
## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
##


##
## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
##

# Change the number of retries when downloading file (default is 20).
tries = 10

# Change the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval (default is 5)
#reclevel = 5

# Change this to "on" to use passive FTP by default.
passive_ftp = off

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
waitretry = 10


##
## Local settings (for a user to set in their $HOME/.wgetrc).
##

# Set email address in header.. Here if needed.
#header = From: michael thomas guldan <michael@guldan.net>

# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
# is *not* sent by default.
#header = Accept-Language: en

# Override the environmental proxy setting
#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# To disable proxy, set this to off.
#use_proxy = on

# You can customize the retrieval outlook.  
# Valid options are default, binary, mega and micro.
dot_style = binary

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
robots = on

# Wait n seconds between connections
#wait = 0

# Follow FTP links from HTML files by default if "on"
#follow_ftp = off
